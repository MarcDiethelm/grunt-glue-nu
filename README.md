# grunt-glue-nu

> Create sprites automatically with Glue, but the Grunt.js way!

This [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) plugin wraps and enhances the [Glue](https://github.com/jorgebastida/glue) command line
spriting tool. It's built as a Grunt [multiTask](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks#task-configuration-and-targets)
that supports extensible task and target-specific options, multiple source locations per target, globbing and so on.

Every task target results in one sprite 'bundle', consisting of the sprite sheet PNG image and a style sheet.
All of Glue's command line [options](http://glue.readthedocs.org/en/latest/options.html) are supported through the
options, adding some sensible defaults in order to minimize the need for configuration.

Glue supports .less style sheet output.

grunt-glue-nu also allows you to send the argument to glue as a string, bypassing the plugin logic. Meaning you can
migrate to this plugin quickly and sort things out later. Or dodge bugs, should the need arise.


## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.2`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-glue-nu --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-glue-nu');
```


## Versions

grunt-glue-nu >= v0.3.0 is compatible with glue >= v0.9.0 <br>
grunt-glue-nu >= v0.2.0 is compatible with glue <= v0.9.1 <br>
grunt-glue-nu  < v0.2.0 is compatible with glue <= v0.4

To make old grunt-glue-nu <= v0.2.0 compatible with glue >= v0.9 in the task options set `debug: false` and remove any offending options that glue complains about. See: [Glue's changelog](http://glue.readthedocs.org/en/latest/changelog.html)

You can install specific version of grunt-glue-nu with `npm install grunt-glue-nu@x.y.z --save-dev`


### Using the glue task

In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `glue` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`. This
section is called a task.

*Minimal config*: You must specify the task target's `src` and `dest` properties.
The file names of the sprite bundle and the sprite namespace will then be the same as the task target. You can change
any aspect of that through the options of course.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
	glue: {
		options: {
			// Task-specific options go here.
		},
		// Target-specific file lists and/or options go here.
		your_target: {
			 src: ['path/to/sprites/'],
			 dest: 'output/folder/'
		}
	}
});
```

**When setting up or troubleshooting** a task it's always a good idea to run grunt with the `--verbose` option to see
information such as the resulting exact arguments used with the `glue` command and which files and folder are being
processed by Glue.

### Options

**You can pass [any command line options supported by glue](http://glue.readthedocs.org/en/latest/options.html) as task
and/or target options.**

In addition grunt-glue-nu has a few configuration options that are not passed on to glue.

- **options.bundleName** `{String} task:target` – The file names of the files created for the sprite bundle. By default they are the same as the task target name.

- **options.tmpDir** `{String} require('os').tmpdir()` – A temporary source folder for glue to operate in. By default it's your OS's temp directory.

- **options.glueArgs** `{Boolean} false` – Use `glueArgs` to set all arguments to the `glue` command manually as a string. All `options`, `src` and `dest` are
	then ignored for this target. 


#### Default options for Glue

grunt-glue-nu sets some defaults for glue options that are deemed helpful.

```js
recursive : true              // process sprites in sub-folders
crop      : true              // crop sprites minimizing empty pixels
force     : true              // forces glue to execute even if it detects no changes in the input
```

Glue by itself will exit with an error code if there are no images in the source folders. grunt-glue-nu catches that, prints a
warning and lets Grunt continue doing its job. 

### Advanced usage example

```js
grunt.initConfig({
	glue: {
		options: { // Defaults for all following tasks
			css                : 'dist',
			less               : true, // Boolean, output to des
			url                : '/static/img',
			namespace          : 's',
			'sprite-namespace' : '',
			retina:            : true
		},
		backgrounds: {
			options: {
				retina: false
			},
			src: ['path/to/sprites/*.{png,jpg,conf}'],
			dest: 'output/folder/'
		},
		icons: {
			options: {
				'sprite-namespace': 'icon'
				less: 'less/output/path' // override dest
			},
			src: ['path/to/sprites/*.png'],
			dest: 'output/folder/'
		},
		modules: {
			options: {
				bundleName: 'module'
				'sprite-namespace': ''
			},
			src: ['modules/carousel', 'modules/accordion'],
			dest: 'output/folder/'
		}
	}
});
```
